# About this directory

This directory contains the input notes (puzzle input). If you're cloning this repository, you should download and provide your own input notes here.

The programs expect the data for part `P` of quest `Q` (0-padded if it's less than 10) to be in a file `{Q}.{P}`, with no file extension. For example, the input notes for part 2 of quest 7 should be in `07.2`. This can be changed by modifying `inputFolder` and `fileOfQuestPart` in [`ECUtils.lean`](../EC2025/ECUtils.lean).
